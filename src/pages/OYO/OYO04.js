        <h2>Wind Powered Car</h2>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
          Carefully cut out a piece of cardboard to form the body of your car.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
          Tape two straws across the bottom of your car, one at each end. Make
          sure the straws are parallel.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          Have an adult use the hobby knife to carefully poke a "+"-shaped hole
          in the center of each bottle cap.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
          Push a wooden skewer through the hole in one of the bottle caps (and
          please push it away from your face!).
        </p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Thread the other end of the skewer through one of the straws.</p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
          Push a bottle cap onto the end of the skewer opposite the first bottle
          cap. You just made an axle with two wheels for your car!
        </p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>Repeat these steps to make the other axle.</p>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <p>
          Make sure the axles can spin and the car can roll smoothly without
          getting stuck. If needed, adjust the wheels so they are not too
          wobbly.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 9</h4>
        <p>
          Have an adult use the hobby knife to carefully poke a small hole in
          the middle of the cardboard.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 10</h4>
        <p>
          Insert a wooden skewer upright into the hole to form a mast for your
          car's sail. Secure it at the base with plenty of tape. If it is still
          too wobbly, you can build a diagonal support out of a piece of
          cardboard.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 11</h4>
        <p>
          Make at least three sails that are all the same shape but different
          sizes. For example, for rectangular sails, you could use a whole sheet
          of paper, a half sheet of paper, and a one-quarter of sheet of paper.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 12</h4>
        <p>Now you have a sail car and sails that are ready to test out!</p>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
          Poke the upright skewer through both ends of your smallest sail to
          hold it in place.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
          Place your fan on the floor at one end of a long hallway or large
          room.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          Place your car in front of the fan and turn the fan on. How far does
          your car go before it stops?
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
          Replace the smallest sail with your next-biggest sail and try again.
          How far does your car go this time?
        </p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>
          Try with your largest sail. Does the car go as far as you expected?
        </p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
          Extra: Try sails that are different shapes. What shape works the best?
        </p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>
          Extra: If you have a variable-speed fan, try the activity on different
          fan settings. How does the fan speed affect how far or how fast your
          car goes?
