        <h3>Wind Powered Car</h3>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Carefully cut out a piece of cardboard to form the body of your car.</li>
            <li>Tape two straws across the bottom of your car, one at each end. Make sure the straws are parallel.</li>
            <li>Have an adult use the hobby knife to carefully poke a "+"-shaped hole in the center of each bottle cap.</li>
            <li>Push a wooden skewer through the hole in one of the bottle caps (and please push it away from your face!).</li>
            <li>Thread the other end of the skewer through one of the straws.</li>
            <li>Push a bottle cap onto the end of the skewer opposite the first bottle cap. You just made an axle with two wheels for your car!</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps to make the other axle.</li>
            <li>Make sure the axles can spin and the car can roll smoothly without getting stuck. If needed, adjust the wheels so they are not too wobbly.</li>
            <li>Have an adult use the hobby knife to carefully poke a small hole in the middle of the cardboard.</li>
            <li> Insert a wooden skewer upright into the hole to form a mast for your car's sail. Secure it at the base with plenty of tape. If it is still too wobbly, you can build a diagonal support out of a piece of cardboard.</li>
            <li>Make at least three sails that are all the same shape but different sizes. For example, for rectangular sails, you could use a whole sheet of paper, a half sheet of paper, and a one-quarter of sheet of paper.</li>
            <li>Now you have a sail car and sails that are ready to test out!</li>
          </ol>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
          <ul>

            <li>Poke the upright skewer through both ends of your smallest sail to hold it in place.</li>
            <li>Place your fan on the floor at one end of a long hallway or large room.</li>
            <li>Place your car in front of the fan and turn the fan on. How far does your car go before it stops?</li>
            <li>Replace the smallest sail with your next-biggest sail and try again. How far does your car go this time?</li>
            <li>Try with your largest sail. Does the car go as far as you expected?</li>
            <li>Extra: Try sails that are different shapes. What shape works the best?</li>
            <li>Extra: If you have a variable-speed fan, try the activity on different fan settings. How does the fan speed affect how far or how fast your car goes?</li>

        </ul>
