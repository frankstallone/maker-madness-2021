      <h2>Kinetic Sticks – Cobra Weave</h2>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        This activity will demonstrate the conversion of potential energy to
        kinetic energy. As craft sticks are weaved into a pattern called a
        “Cobra Weave,” potential energy is built up via the tension in the
        sticks. When one end of the sticks is released, the potential energy is
        converted into kinetic energy, flinging the sticks upward and outward in
        a chain reaction.
      </p>
      <h4>Materials</h4>
      <p>
        Jumbo craft sticks or tongue depressors. The more the merrier. Using
        sticks with different colors adds an artistic and creative flair to the
        activity.
      </p>
      <h4>Safety</h4>
      <p>
        The chain reactions can be a bit vigorous. Safety glasses are
        recommended.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>
        Place stick 2 diagonally underneath stick 1. Stick 1 will serve as an
        “end cap” to hold that end in place.
      </p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img01} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>Place stick 3 over the end of stick 1, parallel to stick 3.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img02} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      <p>
        Weave stick 4 over 3, under 2, and just over 1. At this point, you will
        need to continuously hold onto the end of the chain where you are
        working, or the chain reaction will occur.
      </p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img03} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 4</h4>
      <p>Weave stick 5 under 3, over 2, keeping it parallel to stick 4.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img04} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 5</h4>
      <p>Weave stick 6 under 5, over 4, keeping it parallel to stick 3.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img05} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 6</h4>
      <p>Weave stick 7 under 6, over 3, keeping it parallel to stick 5.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img06} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 7</h4>
      <p>Weave stick 8 under 7, over 5, parallel to stick 6.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img07} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 8</h4>
      <p>Weave stick 9 under 8, over 6, parallel to stick 7.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img08} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 9</h4>
      <p>Weave stick 10 under 9, over 7, parallel to stick 8.</p>
      <img className="transform scale-100" src={img09} alt="logo" />

      <h4>Step 10</h4>
      <p>
        Continue weaving in the same pattern for as long as you like, or lock in
        another “end cap,” (stick 11), to hold everything in place.
      </p>

      <h3>Now the fun!</h3>
      <p>
        To activate the chain reaction, simply loosen the last end cap and let
        go.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Resources</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different chain-reaction patterns that can be created
        using craft sticks. Search online for “popsicle stick chain reactions”
        or “stick bombs” to find a wide range of videos and instructions.
