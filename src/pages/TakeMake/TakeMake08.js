        <h2>Kandinsky's Circles - paper quilling</h2>
        <p>
          The craft of rolling, twisting and curling strips of paper to create
          beautiful pictures, is known as quilling. The name comes from a
          feather quill which was originally used to roll the strips of paper.
          The exact origins of quilling is a mystery but is thought to be
          connected with the invention of paper in China around 105 AD. During
          the Renaissance, French and Italian nuns and monks used quilling to
          decorate book covers and religious items.

        <h2>The Big Idea - abstract art</h2>
        <p>
          Abstract art does not represent what the artist is looking at but
          tries to convey the artists feelings and thoughts using lines, shapes,
          and colors.
